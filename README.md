# Easy Peasy Multiplayer - Extended for Education
### Multiplayer in Godot with Real-time Lecture System

This project is built upon the excellent [Easy Peasy Multiplayer](https://github.com/Skeats/easy-peasy-multiplayer) plugin by Skeats, extending it with a comprehensive lecture presentation system for educational use. The original plugin provides all the backend tools needed to quickly start making networked games in Godot, and we've added a real-time synchronized lecture system that demonstrates advanced multiplayer networking concepts.

## üéì Educational Extensions Added

This version includes significant additions for **2nd year game development students** to learn multiplayer networking:

### **Lecture System Features**
- **Real-time Slide Synchronization**: Instructor controls slides, students follow automatically
- **Independent Navigation**: Students can explore slides independently and return to following
- **Visual Student Tracking**: Instructors see which slides students are viewing
- **Export-Compatible**: Works in both development and exported builds
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed networking system explanation

### **Key Learning Components**
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Host authority and client synchronization
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)**: Real-time communication between instructor and students
- **State Management**: Tracking player positions and slide states
- **Error Handling**: Robust connection management and graceful failures
- **Export Deployment**: Production-ready build configuration

## üöÄ How to Use the Lecture System

### **For Instructors (Hosting a Lecture)**
1. Launch the application
2. Click **"Host Lecture"** on the main menu
3. The system will:
   - Start an ENet server on port 25666
   - Load the slide presentation (dark theme)
   - Allow up to 20 students to connect
4. Use **arrow keys** or **Enter/Space** to navigate slides
5. Students will automatically follow your presentation
6. See visual indicators showing which slides students are viewing

### **For Students (Joining a Lecture)**
1. Launch the application  
2. Click **"Join Lecture"** on the main menu
3. The system will:
   - Connect to the instructor's server
   - Load the slide presentation (synchronized with instructor)
   - Enable "Follow Mode" by default
4. **Navigation Options**:
   - **Auto-follow**: Stay synchronized with instructor's slides
   - **Independent**: Use arrow keys to explore on your own
   - **Return to following**: Click "Follow Host" button to re-sync

### **Controls**
- **Right Arrow / Enter / Space**: Next slide
- **Left Arrow**: Previous slide
- **Follow Host Button**: Return to instructor's current slide
- **Back Button**: Return to main menu

## üéÆ Original Multiplayer Game Features

The original Easy Peasy Multiplayer functionality is fully preserved:

- **ENet/IP Networking**: Traditional server-client multiplayer
- **Steam Networking**: Integration with Steam multiplayer features
- **Easy Network Switching**: Toggle between network types seamlessly
- **Lobby Management**: Create and join game sessions
- **Player Spawning**: Automatic player character management

## üìö Learning Resources

### **Comprehensive Documentation**
üëâ **[Networking System Documentation](NETWORKING_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Detailed explanation of the networking architecture, RPC systems, and deployment guide specifically written for 2nd year game development students.

### **Topics Covered**
- Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer architecture
- TCP vs UDP protocols and ENet hybrid approach
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) implementation
- Real-time state synchronization
- Export compatibility and deployment
- Error handling and debugging
- Professional networking practices

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### **Network Architecture**
- **ENet Protocol**: Reliable UDP for fast, guaranteed delivery
- **Port Separation**: Games use port 7000, lectures use port 25666
- **Authority Model**: Server (host) has authority over game state
- **RPC Communication**: Efficient real-time updates between clients

### **Export Compatibility**
- **Resource-based Loading**: Works in both development and exported builds
- **Diagnostic Systems**: Comprehensive error reporting for deployment issues
- **Production Ready**: Includes deployment guides and troubleshooting

### **Lecture System RPCs**
```gdscript
@rpc("authority", "call_local", "reliable")
func host_slide_changed(slide_number: int)  # Instructor ‚Üí Students

@rpc("any_peer", "call_remote", "reliable") 
func player_slide_changed(slide_number: int)  # Student ‚Üí Instructor

@rpc("any_peer", "call_remote", "reliable")
func request_host_slide()  # New student ‚Üí Instructor
```

## üìã Requirements

### **Dependencies (Included)**
- [GodotSteam](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2445) ‚úÖ Included
- [SteamMultiplayerPeer](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2258) ‚úÖ Included

### **System Requirements**
- **Godot Engine 4.4+**
- **Windows/Linux/macOS** (tested on Windows)
- **Network Access** for multiplayer features
- **Port 25666** open for lecture hosting (configurable)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Development Setup**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open in Godot Engine 4.4+
3. Enable "Easy Peasy Multiplayer" plugin in Project Settings
4. Run the project and test locally

### **Hosting a Lecture**
1. Click "Host Lecture" 
2. Share your IP address with students
3. Students click "Join Lecture"
4. Use arrow keys to present slides

### **Export for Distribution**
1. Go to **Project ‚Üí Export**
2. Select **Windows Desktop** preset
3. **Resources Tab**: Set to "Export all resources in the project"
4. **Features Tab**: Enable "Export With Debug" for testing
5. Export and distribute to students

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- **Can't host lecture**: Check Windows Firewall for port 25666
- **Students can't connect**: Verify instructor's IP address
- **Exported build fails**: See [Networking Documentation](NETWORKING_DOCUMENTATION.md) export guide

### **Debug Information**
